        <p>
          Besides mathematics, I enjoy studying languages. I have spent a long time studying Latin and Ancient Greek; quite a while studying French and Japanese; a small amount of time studying Sanskrit and German; and a tiny amount of time studying Biblical Hebrew and Middle Egyptian. Since 2016 I have occasionally attended the <a href="https://mals.org.au/">Macquarie Ancient Languages School</a>, and since late 2025 I have been part of the <a href="https://www.palaiamq.com/">PALAIA group</a> at Macquarie University. I like thinking about grammar and etymology, so if you have similar interests let's talk!
        </p>
        <p>
          I sometimes dabble with crochet. Here is my small family of Kirby characters, which is currently my magnum opus.
