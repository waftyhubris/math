                Week 1: Spectral Sequences
                </h2>
                <p>
                Abstract: The first talk in our reading group! We will define spectral sequences, and use as our motivating example the spectral sequence of a filtered complex. We will then introduce the spectral sequence of a double complex, and produce quick and marvelous proofs of some results in homological algebra, such as the five lemma and the snake lemma.

                Week 2: Steenrod Squares
                </h2>
                <p>
                Abstract: We will concretely introduce the Steenrod squares, which are precisely the stable cohomology operations on the modulo 2 cochains of a topological space. The method we use is a combination of the ones used by Mosher-Tangora and Lurie. We then prove some of the basic properties of Steenrod squares, including the Cartan formula and the Adem relations.
